Analysis on molecular dynamics simulation of protein-dye conjuates using python

The detailed explanation of motivation, steps and discussions are included in the notebook

The pictures(Picture1.png, Picture2.png and superimpose.png) were included to better describe the problems I was interested.

The movie(ipr-2C.mpg) shows how the dye molecule move over the surface of the protein
